        <strong>Warning!</strong> You are editing a public template which has at least one other template depending on it that is either
        <ul>
            <li>owned by another user or</li>
            <li>owned by you and public at the same time.</li>

        Making this template private will <strong>remove all these dependencies irreversibly</strong>. Dependencies from non-public templates owned by you will not be affected.
